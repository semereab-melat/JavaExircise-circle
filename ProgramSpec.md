### Task


Write a Java application called **Circle1.java** which declares and initialises the radius of a circle and then calculates and prints the diameter, circumference and area. Use the formulae:

<p>Diameter = 2 * radius<br>
Circumference = 2 * π * radius<br>
Area = π * (radius) 2<p>

Try using the **Math.PI** for π and the **Math function** for squaring a number.

Your output should have the following format:

<p>The radius is 4.50 units<br>
The diameter is 9.00 units<br>
The circumference is 28.27 units<br>
The area is 63.62 units squared<p>
